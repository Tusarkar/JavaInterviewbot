What is the significance of the Object class in Java?,"The Object class is the root of the class hierarchy in Java. Every class implicitly inherits from Object and inherits methods such as equals(), hashCode(), and toString()."
What is the default keyword used for in Java interfaces?,"The default keyword is used to provide a default implementation for methods in an interface, allowing interface evolution without affecting existing implementations."
Can you instantiate an abstract class in Java?,"No, you cannot instantiate an abstract class directly. You must create a subclass that implements all abstract methods of the abstract class and then instantiate the subclass."
What happens if you call an abstract method from a constructor of an abstract class?,"Calling an abstract method from a constructor of an abstract class will not compile if the subclass has not implemented the abstract method, as the abstract method must be implemented before creating an instance."
Can a class extend multiple classes in Java?,"No, Java does not support multiple inheritance of classes. A class can only extend one class but can implement multiple interfaces."
Can a static method be overridden in Java?,"No, static methods cannot be overridden. They can be hidden if a subclass defines a static method with the same name and parameters as the superclass method."
What is the difference between method overloading and method overriding with examples?,"Method overloading is defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters in the same class, while method overriding is providing a specific implementation of a method in a subclass that is already defined in the superclass."
Can you override a private method in Java?,"No, private methods cannot be overridden because they are not visible to subclasses. They can only be redefined within the same class."
